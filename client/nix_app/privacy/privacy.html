                                We pay you for your transactions (minus our fees), at a schedule communicated to you once your use of Nutritionix is approved. (Payouts for your card transactions are typically sent to your bank within 7 days). A certain amount of your funds may be subject to an additional hold period (e.g. Reserve Account) with terms determined by your perceived risk and transaction history. You are responsible for refunds, returns, and liable for customer disputes (chargebacks). Complete details

Termination does not alter your liability for processed payments or related chargebacks. This section also includes all the extra legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment). Complete details

                                        Our Service helps you accept and process credit card, debit card and other types of card payments (collectively “Cards”) from your customers who want to pay you for products or services or give donations. Nutritionix’s card processing service supports US-issued card and most non-US issued cards with a Visa, MasterCard, Discover, JCB, or American Express logo (collectively “the Card Networks”) including credit, debit, pre-paid, or gift cards. Nutritionix is not a bank or a money services business (“MSB”) and Nutritionix does not offer banking or MSB services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. In addition, we do not assume any liability for the products or services purchased using our Service. You will be required to register with Nutritionix to use the Service (see Registering for Nutritionix).

                                        We provide the Nutritionix API and other software to enable you to use the Service. We reserve the right to require you install or update any and all software updates to continue using the Service. Our Service also includes software to help you manage recurring and subscription billing charges for your products and services. It is your responsibility to obtain your customers’ consent to be billed on a recurring basis in compliance with applicable legal requirements and Card Network payment rules.

                                        By accepting this agreement, you authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf when such funds from your card transactions settle from the Card Networks. You further authorize Nutritionix to instruct Wells Fargo on how your card transaction settlement funds should be disbursed to you (such as by ACH credit transaction or sending you a paper check payable to you) and the timing of such disbursements. Settlement funds will be held in a deposit account at Wells Fargo pending disbursement of the funds to you in accordance with the terms of this contract. You agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the settlement funds held by Wells Fargo pending settlement to your designated bank settlement account, that you have no right to direct that deposit account, and that you may not assign any interest in the deposit account at Wells Fargo. We may periodically make available to you information in the Nutritionix management dashboard regarding anticipated settlement amounts received on your behalf from the Card Networks and are being held pending settlement. This settlement information does not constitute a deposit or other obligation of Nutritionix or Wells Fargo to you. This settlement information reflected in the Nutritionix management dashboard is for reporting and informational purposes only, and you are not entitled to, and have no ownership or other rights in settlement funds, until such funds are credited to your designated bank settlement account. Your authorizations set forth herein will remain in full force and effect until your Nutritionix Account is closed or terminated.

Nutritionix does not guarantee or assume any liability for transactions authorized and completed which may later be reversed or chargedback (see Chargebacks below). You are solely responsible for all reversed or chargedback transactions, regardless of the reason for, or timing of, the reversal or chargeback. G may add or remove one or more types of cards as supported payment card any time. If we do so we will use reasonable efforts to give you prior notice of the removal.
